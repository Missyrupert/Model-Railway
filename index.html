      <h2>History of Model Railways</h2>
      <p>
        Model railways first appeared in the Victorian era, captivating generations ever since. The UK led the way with iconic makers like Hornby and Tri-ang, inspiring hobbyists to recreate the golden age of rail in miniature. The rise of clubs, exhibitions, and dedicated magazines from the early 20th century made model railways a beloved pastime for all ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        In British popular culture, model railways appear in films like "The Railway Children" and TV shows such as "Thomas & Friends." Today, clubs, layouts, and competitions remain at the heart of UK hobby life.
